# Lecture 03 – CSS Basics

## What I implemented this lecture
- Developed a futuristic "Cyberpunk" theme featuring neon glow effects and a digital background grid.
- Established a professional layout using `max-width` constraints and centering with `margin: 0 auto`.
- Transformed a standard navigation list into a horizontal menu by removing bullets and underlines.

## CSS selectors I used (at least 5)
- **Element selector:** `body`, `h1`, `img` (to set global base styles).
- **Group selector:** `h1, h2, h3` (to apply consistent typography across all headings).
- **Descendant selector:** `nav ul`, `nav li`, `nav a` (to specifically style the navigation structure).
- **Class selector:** `.card` (used for modular content blocks).
- **ID selector:** `#works` (to give a unique accent color to the portfolio section).
- **Pseudo-class:** `a:hover` (to create interactive neon lighting effects).

## One thing I struggled with
- Resolving 404 errors caused by incorrect relative file paths when linking between different project folders.

## One improvement I want to do next
- Integrate CSS `@keyframes` animations to create pulsing neon lights or flickering "glitch" effects for a more immersive sci-fi atmosphere.
