# Lecture 02 – Semantic HTML & Structure

## 1. What I implemented this lecture
- Created a semantic HTML portfolio page using proper structural elements
- Added a portfolio section with an image, GitHub link, and embedded YouTube video
- Applied basic accessibility features such as alt text, skip link, and heading hierarchy

---

## 2. Semantic decisions I made (REQUIRED)

### Decision 1
- Element(s) used: `<header>`
- Where in the page: At the top of the document
- Why this element is semantically correct:
  The `<header>` element is used to present introductory content, including my name and basic personal information, which identifies the page.

### Decision 2
- Element(s) used: `<section>` and `<article>`
- Where in the page: Portfolio & Works section
- Why this element is semantically correct:
  The `<section>` element groups related content under the portfolio theme, while `<article>` represents an individual project that can stand alone.

### Decision 3
- Element(s) used: `<figure>` and `<figcaption>`
- Where in the page: Around the profile image and the embedded video
- Why this element is semantically correct:
  `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` associate media content with descriptive captions, giving clear meaning to images and videos.

## 3. Accessibility considerations
- Added a skip-to-content link to allow keyboard and screen reader users to bypass repetitive content
- Used alt text for images so visually impaired users can understand the content
- Followed a correct heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3) to improve navigation with screen readers
- Used semantic HTML elements to make the page structure clearer

These features improve usability and accessibility for all users.

## 4. What I learned
- How to structure a webpage using semantic HTML elements
- Why semantic tags are important for accessibility and readability
- How to embed media content correctly using semantic elements

---

## 5. What I still need to improve
- Writing more detailed and descriptive content
- Improving accessibility knowledge (ARIA attributes)
- Organizing larger websites with more complex structures

---

## 6. Notes about AI usage (if any)
- Tool used: ChatGPT
- What I accepted as-is: General structure and README template
- What I modified manually: Personal information, project details, interests, and wording
